# Arithmetic Lab

## Assignment
It's time for your first solo assignment since joining the Flatbook team!

Here at Flatbook HQ, we're a bit overwhelmed by all of the user data we've been
collecting, and we need some help crunching the numbers.

There are three challenges we need you to solve. Code your solution in
`index.js`. We'll provide some brief instructions here, but you should really
rely on the test failure messages to guide your code.

## Instructions

1. Create a variable called `multiply` that will multiply `var1` and `var2`
   whose results will equal "62".
2. Create a variable called `random` that will generate a random integer greater
   than 0.
3. Create a variable called `mod` set to an equation whose remainder is equal to
   "4". 
4. Create a variable called `max` that will return "20" as the highest number in
   the set.
